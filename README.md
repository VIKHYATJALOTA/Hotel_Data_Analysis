Problem Statement : 

Atliq Grands, a hotel chain operating across multiple cities in India, is currently encountering stiff competition within its segment, resulting in a decline in revenue and market share.To turn things around, they want to analyze data from May 2022 to June 2022.The primary goal is to utilize Python's built-in libraries to extract valuable insights from provided datasets, focusing on aspects such as ratings, realized revenue, occupancy percentage, and other metrics.


Key learnings from this Python project:

1.)Data Preprocessing is Essential: I learned that cleaning and organizing data is crucial before analysis. Dealing with missing values and outliers ensures more accurate results and better insights.

2.)Data Transformation Adds Value: Introducing new columns, like occupancy percentage, can provide deeper insights into the data. 

3.)Visualization Enhances Understanding: Exploring data through graphs and charts makes it easier to interpret and communicate insights effectively, aiding in decision-making processes.
